# Utility classes

Harmonia is built on **TailwindCSS**, which means you have access to a familiar set of utility classes for styling your components. Most classes either directly map to those in Tailiwnd or work in a very similar way, so you can quickly apply spacing, typography, colors, and other styles without writing custom CSS from scratch.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: **the flexibility of Tailwind** with the **ready-to-use, pre-styled components of Harmonia**, letting you build consistent, responsive interfaces faster.
