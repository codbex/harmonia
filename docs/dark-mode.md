# Dark Mode

Harmonia supports three color schemes: `light`, `dark`, and `auto`.

The default setting is auto, which automatically aligns the application’s color scheme with the user’s browser or operating system preferences. When the system color mode changes, from light to dark or vice versa, Harmonia updates its appearance accordingly in real time, without requiring a page reload.

## API Reference

Harmonia automatically configures the color scheme during initialization, including persisting the user’s most recently selected preference.

To retrieve or manually configure the color scheme, refer to the [Theme](/utilities/theme) utility in the Utilities section.
